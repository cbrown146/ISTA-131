Description:
This program will read in a csv file removing the ',' and setting the index to 0.  
It will remove whitespace and capitalize each word in the rows.  The growth rate 
will be found by subtracting the death rate from the birthrate.  We will add
columns to the DataFrame 'Years to Extinction', 'Growth Rate'.  Later, we will 
sort the countries that are facing extinction.  The sorting will go from the countries 
that face imminent extinctino to the countries that have some time.  

Finally, all of this information will be framed nicely and presented.
